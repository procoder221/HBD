    	<h2 >What is Pritha?</h2>
    	<p >A creature of the past ? a forgotten legend ? or just a good for nothing person . The answer might be unknown but from what I know of her as a person she is one of the most hardworking people I know . She likes to take care of her friends and no matter how shit her ways are her intentions are pure gold or should I say "khara sona" . We might not talk much these days but still I know that our friendship is better than many of her accomplices.

    		 Probably one of the best people I know and to be honest class 11 and 12 would not have been so memorable without you. From bunking classes to stressing out for ISC exams , we have seen it all .Fete was great with you , planning songs , getting threatened and getting threatened again . Without you I would not have realized that getting threats while chilling could be so "enjoyable" and never in my life do I want that happiness . Speaking of which ,normally its too irritating to write good stuff about people  but not for you because its something you deserve (nah bro its killing me).

    		Well these two years have been an insane ride , I mean for all of us you were one of the most valuable people , helping me get out of the class , giving advice and mainly just giving the badge .There is just way too much stuff to write in a single sitting and also I forgot basically everything in quarantine . You must be thinking why the website so I am just gonna throw in the fact that I made it from scratch.
